npm run search "authentication"

# Check symbol index
npm run index --stats

# Validate system
npm run validate

# Detect conflicts
npm run core --conflicts
```

### Daily Workflow
1. **Search first** - `npm run search "topic"` before making decisions

## Core Concepts

### Institutional Memory
The system maintains persistent knowledge of:
- **Architectural Decisions** - Technology choices with rationale and scope
- **Implementation Patterns** - Successful approaches and their contexts
- **System Structure** - Code organization and component relationships
- **Team Conventions** - Standards and preferences that guide development

### Guardrails Enforcement
Automatic enforcement ensures:
- **Decision Checking** - Existing decisions are found and used
- **Gap Detection** - Missing decisions trigger user consultation
- **Immediate Capture** - New decisions are documented instantly
- **Drift Prevention** - Documentation stays current with reality

### Cross-System Integration
The guardrails work with:
- **Any AI Development System** - Universal integration patterns
- **Human Development Workflows** - Team decision-making support
- **Multiple Repositories** - Shared institutional memory across projects
- **Existing Development Tools** - CI/CD, IDE, and workflow integration

## Success Metrics

The guardrails are successful when:
- **Zero Knowledge Loss** - Team changes don't lose institutional knowledge
- **Consistent Implementation** - Same decisions lead to same code patterns
- **Reduced Onboarding Time** - New team members understand standards immediately
- **Prevented Architectural Drift** - Documentation and code stay synchronized

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:
1. **Focus on Guardrails** - Keep content focused on institutional memory management
2. **Include Examples** - Provide concrete examples of guardrails in action
3. **Update Cross-References** - Ensure links between documents stay current
4. **Validate Integration** - Test that examples work with current system
