## Core System Architecture

### Main Components
*[To be populated as system components are identified and documented]*

**Component**: [Name]
- **Location**: `[file path]`
- **Purpose**: [What this component does]
- **Dependencies**: [What it depends on]
- **Used By**: [What uses this component]

## Function Index

### Core Functions
*[To be populated as functions are created and documented]*

**Function**: [functionName]
- **Location**: `[file]:[line number]`
- **Purpose**: [What the function does]
- **Parameters**: [Input parameters]
- **Returns**: [Return value/type]
- **Dependencies**: [What it calls or requires]

## System Connections

### Integration Points
*[To be populated as system integrations are built]*

**Connection**: [ComponentA] â†’ [ComponentB]
- **Type**: [API call, database query, file operation, etc.]
- **Purpose**: [Why this connection exists]
- **Data Flow**: [What data flows between components]
- **Dependencies**: [What this connection requires]

## Discovered Patterns

### Development Patterns
*[To be populated as successful patterns are discovered]*

**Pattern**: [PatternName]
- **Context**: [When this pattern was discovered]

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Libraries
*[To be populated as external dependencies are added]*

**Library**: [LibraryName]
- **Version**: [Version used]
- **Purpose**: [Why this library is used]
- **Components Using**: [Which parts of system use it]
- **Documentation**: [Link to library docs]
